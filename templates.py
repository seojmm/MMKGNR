You are given a sequence of news images first, followed by their corresponding titles.
Each image corresponds to the title at the same index.

# Input
## User's Clicked News Titles
{history}

# Reasoning Process
1. Observe each image and its corresponding title.
2. Extract exactly {triple_count} triples for each image-title pair, focus on the unique role of news image below.
    - News images emphasize entities that appear in both the news image and the title.
    - News images mitigate exaggerated expressions or sensationalized titles by depicting abstract aspects related to the topic or content.

# Output Format
Return your result as a JSON list. Each entry must be in the following structure:

[
  {{
    "title": "<title_1>",
    "triples": [
      ["head1", "relation1", "tail1"],
      ...
    ]
  }},
  ...

prompt_text = """I will give you "News title", "News image". You should extract {triple_count} factual knowledge triples from title and image.
The triples should serve as a knowledge context for personalized news recommendation.
## Caution1: Do NOT rely solely on the title. Primarily use visual information from the image:
- Explicit entities visually emphasized by the image.
- Abstract themes or context shown in the image to avoid sensational biases from the title.
## Caution2: Each triple is seperated with \"\n\" and must be provided in 'head | relation | tail' format without numbering.
## News title: {title}
